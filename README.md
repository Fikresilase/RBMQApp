# RBMQ-App

A desKtop app built to make my research avalaible for public use

## Features

- **Quantizarion:** to introduce bit redundency with a minimal uality loss.
- **bit reduction:** change the bit deph of evry color pixel from 8 to 5 bit.
- **resverce functionality** to decode and get the orignal image.

## Tech Stack

### language:
- Phyton

### Libraries:
- PyQT5
- Numpy
- pillow
## Getting Started
- you can get the RBMQ.exe file in the release and run it directly on your computer, you can also fork or clone the code and run it in your code editor if you are a developer
## Getting Started
- follow the seamless GUI to compress your images
## Caution
- this algorithm is still in the process of testing and development therefore dont use it on your important files and use it with caution
